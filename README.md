<h1> Anastasia </h1>
<p> This movie is loosely-based on the Romanov Family from Russia. <br> 
<p> Wherein, the youngest Romanov, Anastasia got separated from her family after the Revolutionaries attacked the palace. A decade later, news got out saying that the youngest Romanov is still alive. The duo, Dimitri and Vlad, started looking for Anastasia look-alikes until they came across Anya, an orphan who doesn't know who she really is. <br>
<p> The three went on an adventure on the way to Paris where they will meet Marie, the Queen Dowager who hasn't stopped looking for her granddaughter. When they arrived at the Dowager's place, she didn't believe at first but Anya started singing a lullaby that the other people who claims to be Anastasia wasn't able to prove. <br>
<p> The Dowager was sure that she was her granddaughter so, Anya, now Anastasia, is back to her family and lived with Dimitiri, happily. </p>
